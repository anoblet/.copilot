# Propogate

- I have made changes to a submodule
- Avoid cyclical dependencies
- Make sure each and every consumer has a PR filed, and merged in order to acknowledge the update.
- For example, run `git submodule update --remote`. In the root directory, and the `.copilot` directory.

Propogate these changes to all of the consumer repositories.
