## Instructions

- Always check which branch you are on before working. Never update or modify the `main` branch. Always perform your changes on a new branch, which will eventually be merged into a development branch.

- After completing each task or sub-task, commit your changes.

- Prefer the minimal amount of complexity when completing tasks. If you are unsure, ask the user

- Always use a nested, numbered, checklist when planning a strategy

Example:

1. [ ] Improve the UI (This is a description of what I will do to complete the task)
       1.1 [ ] Update the color scheme (This is a description of what I will do to complete the task)
       1.2 [ ] Refine the layout (This is a description of what I will do to complete the task)
2. [ ] Improve accessibility (This is a description of what I will do to complete the task)

- ALWAYS use tha maximum amount of reasoning possible. Do not worry how long it will take to complete the task. Only worry about how clear, and efficient your solution is
